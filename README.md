# Perushim-Project

Perushim Project is an AI project that utilizes the Sefira API to gather and prepare data for generating AI models. The main goal of this project is to create a generative AI model that, given a pasuk (verse) from the Tanach (Hebrew Bible), will generate a commentary on it, using existing commentaries as training data.

## Features

- Data gathering: The project uses the Sefira API to gather the necessary data, including existing commentaries on the Tanach.
- Data preparation: The gathered data is then prepared for model training.
- Model training: The prepared data is used to train a generative AI model.
